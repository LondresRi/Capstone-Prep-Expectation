## üåê About the Project

### üìñ Description
ActorAid is a time management mobile app that coordinates a user‚Äôs schedule to maximize casting audition opportunities.

### ü¶† Known Bugs

* No known bugs.

------------------------------

## üî≠ Scope

### Use Case
<details>
<summary>Expand Use Case</summary>
Users are primarily actors who are struggling with time management. The difficulty of managing shifts at their main-income jobs and time slots for auditions has led to increased stress which affects their capabilities, leading to missed opportunities.

The product will systemize calendars across platforms and apps for viewing regular work hours, a two-click feature for manually adding irregular work hours, creating reminders, and adding alerts for local events such as workshops or new auditions. Time slot conflicts between work hours and events will be alerted to the user so that the conflict can be resolved.

The product will offer line delivery prompts for practice sessions that users can record and save to compare at a later time. The product will store practice times in a chart so that users can see their progress and manage their practice time as they see fit.

The product will prompt the user to input a stress rating twice daily and store their inputs into a chart for users to view their stress levels over time, so that they may better manage it.

The product will offer daily meditation prompts, ranging from 2 to 20 minutes, urging the user to consider their self-care and manage their stress levels. The product will store meditation times in a chart for users to view.

The product will allow users to mitigate their stress by giving them a tool that helps manage their time use and alerts them to the opportunities they are interested in pursuing.
